pointers

**assignments**
for all assignments on online we will see a deadline + extra 24h

pointer example:
int* grades = nullptr; //pointer; always initialized with nullptr
//we don't use NULL (C)


Call Stack

start with main at bottom, continue with functions
error thrown > call stack > double click bolded text to show the line where the error is thrown
NULL Pointer exception thrown = forgot to allocate memory

0xcdcdcdcd => uninitialized value in heap
0xcccccccc => local variable not initialized
